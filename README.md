Fillmore
========

Fillmore is a simple stack based programming language designed for
learning about low level operation.

Fillmore's notation was originally designed on paper, so the following
two programs are equivalent:

```
push 1
push 2
push 3
add
swap
sub
pop 1
jump -7
```

```
← 1
← 2
← 3
+
↔
-
→ 1
↑ -7
```

The Name
--------

Fillmore was developed in the loge of The Fillmore in Detroit, while
waiting for the Welcome to Night Vale live show to begin.
